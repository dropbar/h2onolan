the internet demands that one write at least a thousand words per day if they want to call themselves a serious writer. That is utter bullshit of course. A real writer needs to put at least 5000 words to record every single day if they expect to have anything resembling a reputation as an authentic writer. They must do so drunk, in the middle of the night, while the children scream and slam doors and radicalize, and their spouse goes to bed without announcement.

This isnt a writing blog. this is the latest in a long string of attempts to repackage the things i have googled up in the course of a workday, to be able to point to and say: "Thats my blog! It is very important and full of secrets"

typing practice.
